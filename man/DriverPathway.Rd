  driver_size = 3,
  pop_size = 200,
  iters = 500,
  permut_time = 1000,

}
\arguments{
\item{mutation_matrix}{0-1 mutation matrix where rows represent patients, columns represent genes.}

\item{driver_size}{The size of identified driver gene set, defaulted to 3.}

\item{pop_size}{The population size of GA, defaulted to 200.}

\item{iters}{The iteration time of GA, defaulted to 500.}

\item{permut_time}{The times of permutation test, defaulted to 1000.}

\item{outfile}{The output file of driver gene set.}
}
\description{
This function searches driver pathway using de novo method based on mutual exclusivity and coverage
It outputs the driver pathway and its p-value as a txt file.
